# SmartGAP

SmartGAP is a scenario planning software tool that synthesizes households and firms in a region and determines their travel demand characteristics based on their built environment and transportation policies. It has been developed by RSG Inc for TRB's second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2) Capacity Project C16.

I am not affliated with the original SmartGAP software tool or SHRP 2 C16 project and the repository is created from SmartGAP's open source code for educational purpose. Please contact the original authors of the software and investigators of the project for questions. More information available at [TRB](http://www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/168842.aspx).
